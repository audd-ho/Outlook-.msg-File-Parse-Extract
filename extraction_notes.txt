"extract_data_from_msg_file" function can use either:
"get_parsed_json_pywin32_module" OR "get_parsed_json_raw_read"

If using "get_parsed_json_raw_read" without a module to help parse, there will be the below section

## For old .msg formats, remove for future so no mismatch parts, accidentally wrong for future ones
JSON_portion = re.sub(r'\x1a"', "", JSON_portion)

It is used for cleaning special characters like ticks icon/characters etc! since they will affect the json.loads parsing when it gets parsed into utf-8 as " and affect the key/value delimiters since cut certain strings short with early " or maybe ' or etc for other special characters
Best to not use and include those to reduce its effect on raw parsing and even if used modules, may have such error as well.
